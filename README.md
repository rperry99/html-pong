# html-pong

This is a project from a free Udemy course by Chris DeLeon [here](https://www.udemy.com/code-your-first-game/learn/lecture/2701700?start=75#questions)

## Note

- In his tutorial, he didn't do the styling with CSS, or have separate files. All he used was notepad and a single html docuent with script tags.
- I added the CSS on my own, as well as better organized the project to use separate files for the HTML, CSS, and JS
